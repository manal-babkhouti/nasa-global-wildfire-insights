# 🔥 NASA Global Wildfire Insights

This project presents a comprehensive data science analysis of global wildfire activity during 2024 using satellite data from NASA’s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System). It combines geospatial exploration, classification modeling, and unsupervised learning to understand when, where, and how fires occur — and whether satellite data can predict or uncover hidden patterns.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze global fire detections in 2024 using MODIS satellite data.
- Uncover spatio-temporal patterns in wildfire activity.
- Assess fire intensity and confidence levels.
- Build classification models to predict fire confidence.
- Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to explore class separability.
- Use KMeans clustering to identify latent groupings in fire events.

## 📊 Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, encoded, and sampled over 100,000 fire records.
- **Supervised Learning**: Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` to predict fire confidence class.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied `PCA` and `t-SNE` to visualize separability.
- **Clustering**: Used `KMeans` in embedded spaces to explore natural groupings.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed models via precision/recall/F1-score and adjusted Rand index.

## ✅ Key Insights

- Some satellite features show clear correlation with fire confidence.
- The Random Forest model achieved meaningful classification performance.
- PCA and t-SNE revealed overlap between fire classes, hinting at complexity in feature space.
- Clustering yielded low alignment with true classes — showing unsupervised learning alone may not capture fire confidence without supervision.
