# ðŸ”¥ NASA Global Wildfire Insights

This project presents a comprehensive data science analysis of global wildfire activity during 2024 using satellite data from NASAâ€™s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System). It combines geospatial exploration, classification modeling, and unsupervised learning to understand when, where, and how fires occur â€” and whether satellite data can predict or uncover hidden patterns.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Analyze global fire detections in 2024 using MODIS satellite data.
- Uncover spatio-temporal patterns in wildfire activity.
- Assess fire intensity and confidence levels.
- Build classification models to predict fire confidence.
- Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to explore class separability.
- Use KMeans clustering to identify latent groupings in fire events.

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, encoded, and sampled over 100,000 fire records.
- **Supervised Learning**: Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` to predict fire confidence class.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied `PCA` and `t-SNE` to visualize separability.
- **Clustering**: Used `KMeans` in embedded spaces to explore natural groupings.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed models via precision/recall/F1-score and adjusted Rand index.

## âœ… Key Insights

- Some satellite features show clear correlation with fire confidence.
- The Random Forest model achieved meaningful classification performance.
- PCA and t-SNE revealed overlap between fire classes, hinting at complexity in feature space.
- Clustering yielded low alignment with true classes â€” showing unsupervised learning alone may not capture fire confidence without supervision.
